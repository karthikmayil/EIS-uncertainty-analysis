This repository provides an example of implementation of an uncertainty analysis on a standard experiment for estimating tortuosity of porous electrodes: Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) collected under blocking conditions. This code was used for the analysis in the manuscript

**Quantifying Uncertainty in Tortuosity Estimates for Porous Electrodes**, by Karthik S. Mayilvahanan, Zeyu Hui, Kedi Hu, Jason Kuang, Alison H. McCarthy, John Bernard, Lei Wang, Kenneth J. Takeuchi, Amy C.Marschilok, Esther S. Takeuchi, and Alan C. West

which has been published in the *Journal of the Electrochemical Society* and can be found [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/1945-7111/ac1316/meta), open access.

This repository takes published impedance spectra from Wang et. al. [1], who analyzed the tortuosity of an assortment of electrodes. The phase and magnitude data published in the appendix is extracted using WebPlot Digitizer [2], and analyzed using impedance.py [3].
